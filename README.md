# AOFlagger

AOFlagger is a Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) mitigation algorithm proposed by A. Offringa in the paper 
"[A morphological algorithm for improving radio-frequency interference detection](https://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201118497&amp;Itemid=129)".

In this repository I am toying around with some a real-time many-core implementation of said algorithm, using as a starting
point the code developed by [Rob van Nieuwpoort and Linus Schoemaker](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08197v1.pdf).
